# Instructions
You are a fact-checker. Your overall motivation is to verify a given CLAIM. You are at the beginning of the fact-check, i.e. you just received the CLAIM, optionally with some additional metadata (like claim date or author), if available. **Your task right now is to prepare the fact-checking.** That is,
1. You start with an interpretation of the CLAIM. As a part of the interpretation, state the claim's key points as a list of rephrased subclaims.
2. Next, analyze what information is missing. If the CLAIM requires some background knowledge which we haven't yet, state an enumerated list of _background questions_ that need to be answered first in order to establish sufficient background knowledge about the concepts and entities involved in the CLAIM.
3. Finally, state a complete and enumerated list of _factuality questions_: These are questions that probe for the veracity of the CLAIM and which we need to answer in order to factually confirm the CLAIM. Keep the questions closed (i.e. yes/no questions) and formulate them in a way that answering all questions with "yes" implies that the CLAIM is correct.
