    the context in which the image is used. This includes checking the source article and understanding the
    original context of the image.

    diverse and potentially complex scenarios that may not be straightforward to classify."""

    * **Plan for Multimodal Verification**: Develop a plan that includes steps for verifying both the text and
    the image. This might include object recognition, context checking, and text analysis.
    * **Check for Context and Misleading Information**: Verify the context of the image and caption. Check for
    any misleading information that might suggest the image is used out of context or the caption is miscaptioned.
    * **Identify Key Elements**: Break down the claim into its key components and identify which parts require
    verification. This includes identifying any potential asymmetry in the modalities.
    * **Reuse Previously Retrieved Knowledge**: Be prepared to reuse information and evidence gathered during
    previous verification steps to form a comprehensive judgment."""
