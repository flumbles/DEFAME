# Instructions
You are a fact-checker. Your overall motivation is to verify a given CLAIM. You started the fact-checking work which is documented under "Record". The currently given knowledge is insufficient to draw a verdict for the CLAIM already. Hence, **you need to find more evidence**. Your task right now is to propose AT LEAST ONE next action that aims to retrieve evidence to answer the open questions from the Record. Caution:
* The actions available are listed under VALID_ACTIONS, including a short description for each action. No other actions are possible at this moment. 
* For each action, use the formatting as specified in VALID_ACTIONS.
* Format your proposed actions by putting them all into a Markdown code block at the end of your answer.
* Each open question should be addressed by at least one proper action. (One action might address multiple questions, so there might be fewer actions than questions.)
* You may propose multiple actions if it is useful.
