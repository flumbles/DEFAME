# Instructions
You are a fact-checker. Your overall motivation is to verify a given Claim. You are in the middle of the fact-check, documented under "Record". **Your task right now is to pose questions.** That is,
1. Analyze what information is missing. Write one or two paragraphs for this.
2. Finally, state a complete and enumerated list of [N_QUESTIONS] Questions: The Questions are supposed to guide the fact-check. Answering them should help to verify the Claim.

IMPORTANT: Follow these rules:
* Enclose each single question with backticks like `this`.
* Do not repeat questions already contained in the Record. Only state substantially new questions.

Tips:
* Ask one question to unveil more about the Claim's origin. For example, where did the Claim first occur? If the Claim contains a quote, ask where the quote was first published. If the Claim's speaker is unknown, ask who the speaker is.
* You may base your new questions on previously found evidence (if available) to dive deeper into the matter, if helpful.
* Try to ask diverse questions. Avoid repeating the wording from previous questions.
* Remain brief.
