0,"In a letter to Steve Jobs, Sean Connery refused to appear in an apple commercial.",REFUTED,REFUTED,"There is no evidence to support the claim that Sean Connery wrote a letter to Steve Jobs refusing to appear in an Apple commercial. Instead, the letter in question was revealed to be a [satire piece](https://www.cnet.com/culture/fake-sean-connery-letter-to-steve-jobs-goes-viral/) from a humor website and not an actual communication from Connery to Jobs. Multiple credible sources, including [Snopes](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/false-sean-connery-letter-to-apple/) and [CNET](https://www.cnet.com/culture/fake-sean-connery-letter-to-steve-jobs-goes-viral/), confirm that the story originated from a satirical website called Scoopertino, which fabricated the entire scenario as part of a humorous article.",True,The answer and sources show that the claim was published in a fake news site so the claim is refuted.
1,Trump Administration claimed songwriter Billie Eilish Is Destroying Our Country In Leaked Documents,REFUTED,SUPPORTED,"Multiple sources confirm that leaked Trump Administration documents accused Billie Eilish of ""destroying our country and everything we care about"" ([Finance Yahoo!](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/leaked-trump-admin-document-describes-191559664.html), [Business Insider NL](https://www.businessinsider.nl/the-trump-administration-accused-billie-eilish-of-destroying-our-country-and-everything-we-care-about-in-newly-leaked-documents/)). The documents were part of a $250 million advertising contract aimed at ""defeating despair and inspiring hope"" during the pandemic, and HHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Michael Caputo was involved in the process. While the authenticity of the documents can't be fully verified, top-ranking Democrats referenced them, lending credibility to their existence. Notably, the language used in the leaked documents seems inconsistent with the Trump Administration's previous rhetoric and policy positions towards the music industry.",False,Seems that the Wzshington post accused the singer wrong lyrics. Therefore the claim is refuted
2,"Due to Imran Khan's criticism of Macron's comments on Islam, French authorities cancelled the visas of 183 Pakistani citizens and deported 118 from the country.",REFUTED,NEI,"There is no conclusive evidence to prove that French authorities cancelled the visas of 183 Pakistani citizens and deported 118 others directly due to Imran Khan's criticism of Macron's comments on Islam. Existing tensions between Pakistan and France preceded the reported events, but lacking transparent explanations from French authorities and acknowledgment from Imran Khan's administration, the motivation behind their actions remains unclear. Therefore, the claim lacks sufficient evidence to be verified. [Source](https://newscomworld.com/2020/10/27/imran-khan-risking-the-future-of-pakistanis-in-france/)",False,The tweet was not the official government page and there is no evidence that visas were cancelled so the claim is refuted.
3,UNESCO declared Nadar community as the most ancient race in the world.,REFUTED,REFUTED,"The claim that UNESCO declared the Nadar community as the most ancient race in the world is refuted due to lack of evidence. Despite being a real ethnic or social group with a documented history, there is no record of UNESCO making such a declaration, nor is it supported by official UNESCO documents, expert opinions, or credible news sources. In fact, UNESCO rejects the idea of declaring certain communities as the ""most ancient"" races in the world, emphasizing the unity of humanity and rejecting notions of inherent superiority based on ethnicity or nationality [http://www.honestthinking.org/en/unesco/UNESCO.1950.Statement_on_Race.htm](http://www.honestthinking.org/en/unesco/UNESCO.1950.Statement_on_Race.htm).",True,"This claim is refuted. According to the QA pairs, UNESCO have never declared a ""most ancient race"", and for those who have analysed this question, they have theorised that the San people of southern Africa may be the most ""ancient race""- no the Nadar community. Therefore, this claim is refuted."
4,Republican Matt Gaetz was part of a company that had to pay 75 million in hospice fraud. They stole from dying people.,REFUTED,REFUTED,"Matt Gaetz's father, Don Gaetz, co-founded a hospice company called Vitas, which was later involved in a Medicare fraud scandal and settled the case for over $75 million [1]. Although Matt Gaetz held roles at Vitas, there is no direct evidence suggesting he was personally involved in or benefited financially from the fraudulent activities [2]. The claim implies Matt Gaetz was directly responsible for the fraud, which is not supported by the evidence. Therefore, the claim is refuted.",True,The company was sold in 2004 and the law suit was filed in 2013
5,The United States of America and its Western allies have been using their media outlets to publish articles based on fabricated information under allegations of non-compliance with the Chemical Weapons Convention.,REFUTED,SUPPORTED,"Several news outlets published articles accusing Russia of non-compliance with the Chemical Weapons Convention around October 30, 2020, due to the poisoning of Alexei Navalny with a Novichok nerve agent [([Source](https://armscontrolcenter.org/fact-sheet-chemical-weapons/))]. Although examples of allegedly fabricated information can be identified, including sensationalized headlines without proper sourcing and false claims [([Source](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/american-web-media-awm/))], direct evidence of fabricated information in specific articles remains lacking. Independent investigations and fact-checking efforts were conducted to verify the accuracy of information presented regarding chemical weapons usage, specifically mentioning the OPCW's verification of Syria's declared chemical stocks and facilities [([Source](https://armscontrolcenter.org/fact-sheet-chemical-weapons/))].

6,"More than 225,000 people dead, 225,000. The estimates are, if we’d have acted responsibly, there’d be 160,000 fewer dead than there are today, because of covid-19.",SUPPORTED,SUPPORTED,"Joe Biden's claim that 160,000 fewer people would have died from COVID-19 if the country had acted responsibly is supported by indirect evidence. While the exact figure isn't backed by scientific modeling or data analysis, peer-reviewed studies suggest similar mortality rate reductions under hypothetical scenarios [1]. Expert recommendations, like mandating face coverings in public, also align with Biden's notion of acting responsibly [2]. Although the CDC, NIAID, and others proposed alternative strategies, the idea that prompt action could have saved tens of thousands of lives is consistent with existing research findings [3].

7,"Why should you pay more taxes than Donald Trump pays? And that’s a fact. $750. Remember what he said when that was raised a while ago, how he only pays … He said, ‘Because I’m smart. I know how to game the system.’",SUPPORTED,SUPPORTED,"Joe Biden's claim that Donald Trump pays only $750 in taxes and boasts about gaming the system is largely accurate. While Trump didn't explicitly admit to paying $750, credible sources like [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/) confirm he paid this amount in 2016 and 2017. Trump also made a statement similar to 'I'm smart; I know how to game the system' during a 2016 presidential debate, suggesting he takes pride in minimizing his tax payments. Although it's unclear how his tax payment compares to others in similar income brackets, the fact remains that his reported tax payment is extremely low.",True,"True, question mark required (?) "
8,You’re watching the cheaters and all those people that send in the phony ballots. … They want to have the count weeks after November 3.,REFUTED,REFUTED,"Donald Trump's claim that people are sending in phony ballots and wanting to delay the count until weeks after November 3rd is refuted. Despite his assertions, there is no concrete evidence of widespread voter fraud involving mail-in ballots [1]. In fact, experts and government investigations have consistently found little to no evidence of significant voter fraud [1][2]. Furthermore, states have mechanisms in place to verify the authenticity of mail-in ballots before counting them [7], and while there have been isolated incidents of voter fraud, these are extremely rare [2][6]. The claim also ignores the reality of the 2020 presidential election, where several states changed their mail-in balloting procedures or regulations due to the COVID-19 pandemic [10].

9,"You see the number today? 33.1 GDP. The biggest in the history of our country by almost triple, right? Almost triple. Now it’s very much bigger than any GDP we’ve ever had. You have to go back to the 1950s, and then it’s less than half. This is the greatest number, 33.1 percent.",NEI,CONFLICTING,"Donald Trump's claim that the 33.1% GDP growth rate is the largest in U.S. history is partially accurate but misleading. Although the [Bureau of Economic Analysis](https://www.bea.gov/resources/learning-center/what-to-know-gdp) reported a 33.1% GDP growth rate in Q3 2020, this figure is based on a single quarter's performance and is not the highest recorded in U.S. history ([USA Facts](https://usafacts.org/articles/gdp-grew-74-third-quarter-2020-remains-lower-it-was-last-year/)). Exceptional circumstances, such as federal stimulus packages and aid, contributed to this growth rate ([Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2020/10/29/us-economy-turns-in-record-q3-growth-but-crisis-is-not-over)), and the Claim ignores important caveats, distorting the context and implications of this figure.",False,There is only one question and that is unanswerable. There is no evidence about the GDP in 2020 when the claim was made. Therefore there is not enough evidence to refute or support the claim.
10,"Donald Trump, when he thinks of climate change, he says hoax. Well, guess what? Speaking of hoaxes, remember what he said about these increasing violent hurricanes and the frequency? He actually said, maybe we should detonate a nuclear bomb over the Atlantic. By the way, the same stable genius who said the biggest problem we had in the Revolutionary War is we didn’t have enough airports.",CONFLICTING,SUPPORTED,"Joe Biden's claim is supported because, although there is no direct quote from Donald Trump calling climate change a hoax, Trump has expressed skepticism towards climate change and its causes [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/two-government-websites-climate-change-survive-trump-era-n891806). Credible sources like Axios confirm that Trump suggested using nuclear bombs to stop hurricanes, which is deemed unfeasible and potentially harmful [Axios](https://www.axios.com/trump-hurricanes-nuclear-bombs-34f12bac-23ab-48cb-a941-6b3eea85795d.html). Furthermore, Trump demonstrated a lack of understanding of historical facts when he commented about airports during the Revolutionary War [Snopes](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/trump-revolutionary-war-airports/). Overall, the evidence supports Biden's assertion that Trump has made misinformed and outlandish statements about climate change, hurricanes, and historical events.",False,"There is a few too many claims in this claim, so while one is true, he did say we should detonate a nuclear bomb, i cannot confirm all are true "
11,The U.S. surgeon general and the Centers for Disease Control both previously said that ‘masks are not effective in preventing [the] general public from catching coronavirus.’,CONFLICTING,REFUTED,"The Claim that the U.S. Surgeon General and the CDC said masks are not effective in preventing the general public from catching coronavirus is refuted. Despite initial reservations due to PPE shortages, both organizations ultimately acknowledged the importance of face coverings in preventing COVID-19 transmission ([U.S. Surgeon General](https://www.fox5ny.com/news/im-begging-you-us-surgeon-general-pleads-with-americans-to-wear-face-masks-amid-virus-surge)) and currently recommend wearing masks as a means of reducing transmission within communities ([CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html)).",False,There is a 79% reduction made in certain situations.

12,New Zealand’s new Food Bill bans gardening,REFUTED,REFUTED,"The claim that New Zealand's new Food Bill bans gardening is entirely unfounded. A thorough review of the Food Act 2014 reveals no explicit mentions of restrictions or prohibitions on personal gardening activities [1]. In fact, individuals can still grow their own fruits and vegetables for personal consumption under the current regulations outlined in the Food Bill [2]. No reputable news sources or agricultural organizations reported on the alleged gardening ban, and local authorities or law enforcement agencies in New Zealand did not indicate how they will enforce a supposed gardening ban, as no such ban seems to exist [3][4].

13,Wearing face masks will stop the spread of covid 19,SUPPORTED,SUPPORTED,"The verdict is supported because multiple peer-reviewed studies demonstrate a statistically significant reduction in COVID-19 cases directly attributed to widespread face mask usage ([PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32543923/)). Public health organizations such as the [World Health Organization (WHO)](https://verafiles.org/articles/vera-files-fact-sheet-ang-mga-maling-palagay-sa-face-mask-in-2) and [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://verafiles.org/articles/vera-files-fact-sheet-ang-mga-maling-palagay-sa-face-mask-in-2) recommend face masks as a primary method to prevent COVID-19 transmission. Real-world examples show that mandatory face mask policies have led to a significant decline in COVID-19 cases. While face masks alone may not be enough to completely eliminate the risk of transmission, the evidence strongly suggests that they play a crucial role in reducing the spread of COVID-19 when used in combination with other measures like social distancing and hand hygiene.",True,"From the question and answer pair it does indeed seem that face masks are useful in stopping the spread of covid19. Therefore, the claim is supported."
14,Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) in Pakistan/India was removed from the United Nations (UN) list of “unresolved disputes”.,REFUTED,NEI,"While the United Nations acknowledges the ongoing dispute over Jammu and Kashmir, there is no direct evidence of a formal list of ""unresolved disputes"" maintained by the UN. Despite Pakistan's consistent urging for UN intervention, there is no concrete evidence of Jammu and Kashmir being officially recognized as an ""unresolved dispute"" prior to October 29, 2020. Furthermore, there is no public record of all countries or regions listed as ""unresolved disputes,"" nor did the UN General Assembly or Security Council formally decide to remove Jammu and Kashmir from such a list between January 1, 2019, and October 29, 2020. Without sufficient evidence, the claim cannot be supported. [Source](https://www.un.org/en/library/unms).",False,The answer and source show that they were never on the list so the claim is refuted.
15,"Illegal drug, border crossings, and human smuggling activities have decreased in areas where barriers are deployed in the United States.",NEI,NEI,"The claim that ""illegal drug, border crossings, and human smuggling activities have decreased in areas where barriers are deployed in the United States"" is partially supported, but lacks sufficient evidence to conclusively attribute the decreases to the presence of barriers. While there are signs of reductions in illegal activities, analysts suggest that smugglers adapt to physical barriers, and other factors like changed policing strategies, resource allocation, and legislation also contribute to the complex issue. [Source](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/homesec/R46218.pdf).",True,"15 miles of new barriers seems unlikely to account for the halving of illegal crossing from 2019 to 2020. Particularly as 2019 is the outlier in the period 2018 to 2020.

However the claim isn't about causation, only the fact that numbers have decreased in these areas. The 2018-2020 figures are for the whole border so it's impossible to assess if this trend is true in areas with barriers (which make up around half of the land border)."
16,The plentiful evidence we have indicates that masks would not meaningfully help with aerosol transmission of COVID 19.,REFUTED,REFUTED,"The claim that masks do not meaningfully help with aerosol transmission of COVID-19 is refuted. Despite the lack of supporting evidence from the claimant, numerous peer-reviewed journal articles, expert opinions, and guidelines from reputable health organizations like [World Health Organization](https://www.vox.com/2020/6/6/21282108/masks-for-covid-19-world-health-organization-guidelines-cloth-n95) and [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/) confirm that masks can significantly reduce the transmission of COVID-19. Studies estimate that mask-wearing reduces transmission rates by varying degrees, depending on factors such as compliance, mask quality, and environmental conditions ([preprints.org](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202004.0203/v2)). The scientific consensus is clear: masks are an effective measure in reducing aerosol transmission of COVID-19.",True,"Evidence finds that surgical face masks could prevent transmission of human coronaviruses and influenza viruses from symptomatic individuals. The CDC and the World Health Organization (WHO), at the time of the claim, also recommended cloth masks for the general public."
17,All USA Ballots Arriving After Election Day Will Be Thrown Out,REFUTED,REFUTED,"The Claim ""All USA Ballots Arriving After Election Day Will Be Thrown Out"" is refuted because there is no federal law mandating this, individual states have their own laws and regulations, and there have been instances where ballots arriving after Election Day were accepted and counted in previous US elections [1](https://www.votewalton.com/Voting/Ways-to-Vote). High courts, including the Supreme Court, have also ruled on similar cases, showing that the issue is not always straightforward [2](https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-samuel-alito-amy-coney-barrett-north-carolina-elections-4cb4c214446bcfadbd73dafca9353701). Overall, the Claim oversimplifies the complexities of electoral laws and regulations across the United States.",True,"Two sources confirm that postal ballots received after election day can still be counted, therefore not all will be thrown out."
18,Even if your mail-in ballot is postmarked prior to the Election day but arrives after the Election day it will be thrown out.,CONFLICTING,REFUTED,"The claim that mail-in ballots postmarked prior to Election Day but arriving after will always be thrown out is refuted because individual states have varying laws and regulations governing mail-in ballots, with some accepting ballots postmarked by Election Day and arriving within a specified timeframe afterwards ([California](https://www.democracydocket.com/analysis/mailing-in-your-vote-important-dates/) and [Illinois](https://chicagoelections.gov/voting/vote-mail)) and others discarding those arriving after Election Day despite earlier postmarks ([Michigan](https://www.democracydocket.com/analysis/mailing-in-your-vote-important-dates/) and [Florida](https://www.ocfelections.com/vote-by-mail)). The complexity and variability of these regulations render the claim overly broad and misleading.",False,The claim is cherrypicking as some states do accept the ballots and some do not.

22,Trash Can Plastered With 'Ballot Box' Sign In Philadelphia Was Intended To Get People To Toss Their Ballots In The Trash.,REFUTED,REFUTED,"While a trash can with a ""Ballot Box"" sign was indeed observed in Philadelphia around October 27, 2020 ([source](https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/election-2020-ballot-box-trash-can-ad-philadelphia-union-league-foundation-20201023.html)), and the Union League Legacy Foundation took responsibility for placing the signs, apologizing for any potential confusion caused, there is no conclusive evidence to suggest that their intention was to deceive voters into throwing away their ballots. Furthermore, the incident seemed to have had a limited impact, with only 9 reported cases of discarded ballots linked to it ([source](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-attorney-battleground-pennsylvania-investigating-small-number-mail/story?id=73230513)). Therefore, the claim is refuted.",True,From the question and answer pair it seems that the claim is refuted.

There is no recorded instance of Biden advocating for a national ban on fracking, and reputable news sources have consistently reported on his denial of plans to ban fracking.",True,From the Q&A it seems Joe biden has never said he wants to ban fracking. So the claim is refuted.

Reliable sources, including scientific journals, government organizations, and fact-checking websites, consistently debunked the conspiracy theory. Bill Gates has been shown to have warned about the risks of pandemics and promoted pandemic preparedness and vaccination development, but there is no evidence linking him to planning the pandemic. Whistleblower or insider testimony, unusual patterns in global health data, and official investigations also failed to implicate Bill Gates. Therefore, the claim is refuted.",True,"It is clearly stated in the QA that the notion that covid is pre-planned is false, therefore the claim is refuted"

While ""pox parties"" were previously used to build immunity against chickenpox, there is no scientific basis to support the claim that it can lead to herd immunity against COVID-19 [1]. Reputable health organizations have not endorsed this idea, and it raises significant ethical concerns, violating human rights and posing risks to children's health, particularly those with compromised immune systems [2][3].

98,The iPhone 12 won’t come with earphones and a charging adapter.,SUPPORTED,SUPPORTED,"Apple officially announced changes to the iPhone 12 packaging, omitting the charger and implying the exclusion of earphones, citing environmental concerns [1](https://www.wired.com/story/everything-apple-announced-october-2020/) and [2](https://www.apple.com/environment/pdf/products/iphone/iPhone_12_PER_Oct2020.pdf). The company confirmed that a charging adapter will not be included, and while earphones are not explicitly excluded, the implication is strong. This supports the claim that the iPhone 12 won't come with earphones and a charging adapter.",True,"Evidence shows that Apple has removed the earphones and a charging adapter from Iphone 12 boxes to reduce carbon emissions and cut back on the mining and use of materials used to make these items. Hence, the claim is supported."
99,New Zealand's Abortion Legislation Act (2020) does not make it a legal requirement that babies born alive after an abortion are given medical support.,REFUTED,SUPPORTED,"The Abortion Legislation Act 2020 in New Zealand does not explicitly require medical professionals to provide medical support to babies born alive during or after an abortion attempt, although it does prioritize the woman's physical and mental well-being after an abortion attempt [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_Legislation_Act_2020). Failure to provide adequate medical support would likely violate Section 175 of the Crimes Act 1961 [Te Ara](https://teara.govt.nz/en/abortion/page-5). Despite indirect implications of care, there is no clear mandate for medical professionals to provide medical support in such cases, supporting the claim that the Act does not make it a legal requirement to give medical support to babies born alive after an abortion attempt.",False,The answer and source show that the claim is not correct so it is refuted.
