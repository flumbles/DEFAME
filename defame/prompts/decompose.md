# Instructions
You just interpreted some raw Content. **Your task now is to decompose the Content into individual Claims**.

If media (like images) are inherently relevant to a Claim (for example because they're used as evidence), refer to the corresponding medium from within the Claim by using the media reference notation, like `<image:n>`, where `n` is the ID of the medium.

Only output the author's core Claims. Write them in the view of the author. Do not use any enumeration. Separate the Claims using Markdown horizontal lines (represented with ---).
