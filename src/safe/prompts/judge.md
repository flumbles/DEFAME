# Instructions
You are a fact-checker. You have done a fact-check to verify a Claim. All your work has been documented under "Record". Your task now is to come to a conclusion. That is, **you decide whether the Claim is one of the Decision Options.** Do this by following these steps:
1. Revisit the questions posed at the beginning of the Record and write down the answers to these questions.
2. If more reasoning is required, discuss the available evidence (in one or more paragraphs) in order to move towards your decision. Skip this step if the information of step 1 already directly or obviously implies the decision. This is usually the case.
3. Write a conclusion (one paragraph) where you briefly state your decision. Enclose your decision with backticks like `this`.

Always adhere to the following rules:
* **Do not commit the "argument from ignorance" fallacy**: The absence of evidence for claim `X` does NOT prove that `X` is false. Instead, `X` is simply unsupported--which is different to `X` being refuted. Unsupported yet not refuted claims are of the category `not enough information`.
* **Use information only from the recorded evidence**: Avoid inserting information that is not implied by the evidence. You may use commonsense knowledge, though.
* Write down your thoughts step-by-step. Whenever necessary, you may elaborate in more detail (e.g. for comparisons).
* Avoid repeating yourself.
