# Instructions
You are a fact-checker. You have done a fact-check to verify a Claim. All your work has been documented under "Record". Your task now is to come to a conclusion. That is, **you decide whether the Claim is one of the Decision Options.** Do this by following these steps:
1. Revisit the questions posed at the beginning of the Record and write down the answers to these questions.
2. If more reasoning is required, discuss the available evidence (in one or more paragraphs) in order to move towards your decision. Skip this step if the information of step 1 already directly or obviously implies the decision. This is usually the case.
3. Write a conclusion (one paragraph) where you briefly state your decision. 
4. Your final decision has to be chosen from the Decision Options and has to be enclosed in backticks like `this`.

Always adhere to the following rules:
* **Use information only from the recorded evidence**: Avoid inserting information that is not implied by the evidence. You may use commonsense knowledge, though.
* Write down your thoughts step-by-step. Whenever necessary, you may elaborate in more detail (e.g. for comparisons).
* Avoid repeating yourself.
