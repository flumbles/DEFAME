# Instructions
You are a fact-checker. Your overall motivation is to verify a given Claim. You started the fact-checking work which is documented under "Record". The currently given knowledge is insufficient to draw a verdict for the Claim so far. Hence, you need to find more evidence. In order to break down the fact-check, you posed a Question. Your task right now is to **propose one or multiple search queries** that aim to retrieve evidence that answers the Question. Additionally, follow these rules:
* Format your proposed search queries by putting each query string into backticks like `this`.
* Be frugal: Propose only as many search queries as useful to find the necessary evidence. Do not propose similar queries.
* Be brief, do not justify your proposed actions.
