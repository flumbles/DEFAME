Instructions:
1. You have been given a STATEMENT and KNOWLEDGE points.
2. Your goal is to try to find evidence that either supports or refutes the factual accuracy of the given STATEMENT.
3. To do this, you are allowed to issue ONE Wikipedia search query. Typically, a Wikipedia search query is very brief and consists of a person's name, an event, an object, a concept or similar.
4. Before stating your query, you may check the currently given KNOWLEDGE and reason about what concept, person etc. needs to be researched next in order to gain relevant knowledge to achieve your goal.
5. Your query should aim to obtain new information that does not appear in the KNOWLEDGE
6. Your query MUST be different to all PAST_QUERIES. Ensure that there is not a query in PAST_QUERIES that is the same (or very similar) to your proposed query. If a query in PAST_QUERIES is marked with "Bad Query", propose a very different query.
7. Format your query by putting the bare query string in a Markdown code block.
