# Instructions
You just interpreted some raw Content. **Your task now is to decompose the Content into individual Claims**.

If media (like images) are inherently relevant to a Claim (for example because they're used as evidence), refer to the corresponding medium by including the respective reference (e.g., `<image:n>`).

Only output the core Claims implied by the Content. Formulate each Claim as a factual assertion about the real world. Ensure that each Claim is self-contained, i.e., clear without additional context.. Do not use any enumeration. Separate the Claims with double newlines.
