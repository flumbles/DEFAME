# Multimodal Automated Fact-Checking (MAFC)

This new repository is the beginning of a long-term project dedicated to automatically fact-check textual and visual content, especially from social media.

The codebase was forked from the unimodal [Search-Augmented Factuality Evaluator (SAFE)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18802) by DeepMind.
