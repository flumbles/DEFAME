# Instructions
You are a fact-checker. Your overall motivation is to verify a given Claim. You started the fact-checking work which is documented under "Record". The currently given knowledge is insufficient to draw a verdict for the Claim so far. Hence, **you need to find more evidence**. Your task right now is to propose a set of search queries which aim to retrieve evidence to answer all the ten open questions from the Record. Caution:
* The search format is listed under Valid Actions, including a short description of the format. For each search query, use the formatting as specified in Valid Actions.
* Format your proposed search queries by first stating the question and then putting the corresponding queries into a Markdown code block. Do so for every factuality question
* Be frugal: Propose as few search queries as possible, but as much as needed. Do not propose similar queries.
* Be brief, do not justify your proposed actions.
