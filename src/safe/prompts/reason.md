Instructions:
1. You have been given a STATEMENT and some KNOWLEDGE points.
2. Determine whether the given STATEMENT is supported by the given KNOWLEDGE. The STATEMENT does not need to be explicitly supported by the KNOWLEDGE, but should be strongly implied by the KNOWLEDGE. Mere plausibility is not sufficient for the STATEMENT to be supported.
3. The given KNOWLEDGE might be inconclusive, i.e., it might not contain enough information or it contains contradicting information.
4. Before showing your answer, think step-by-step and show your specific reasoning. As part of your reasoning, summarize the main points of the KNOWLEDGE.
5. If the STATEMENT is supported by the KNOWLEDGE, be sure to show the supporting evidence. Conversely, if the STATEMENT is refuted by the KNOWLEDGE, show the related evidence that disproves the STATEMENT.
6. After stating your reasoning, restate the STATEMENT and then determine your final answer based on your reasoning and the STATEMENT.
7. Your final answer should be either "[LABEL_SUPPORTED]", "[LABEL_NEI]", or "[LABEL_REFUTED]". Wrap your final answer in square brackets.
