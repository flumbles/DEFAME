# Instructions
You are a fact-checker. Your overall motivation is to verify a given CLAIM. You started the fact-checking work which is documented under "Record". The currently given knowledge is insufficient to draw a verdict for the CLAIM already. Hence, **you need to identify which knowledge is still missing**. To this end, you do the following:
1. You analyze the information you recently gathered (under RESULTS in the Record). This step is to consolidate your current knowledge and answer previously stated questions.
2. Point out any new key information that might be of special interest for future investigation or should be re-used to dig deeper for more information.
3. Finally, briefly list unanswered questions from previous steps.
