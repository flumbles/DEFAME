# Instructions
You are a fact-checker. Your overall motivation is to verify a given Claim. You are in the middle of the fact-check, documented under "Record". **Your task right now is to pose questions.** That is,
1. Analyze what information is missing. Write one or multiple paragraphs for this.
2. Finally, state a complete and enumerated list of [N_QUESTIONS] Questions: The Questions are supposed to guide the fact-check. Answering them should help to verify the Claim.

IMPORTANT: Follow these rules:
* State every single question in a way that it can be understood independently and without additional context. Therefore, be explicit and do not use pronouns or generic terms in place of names or objects. However, you might refer to the claim.
* Enclose each single question with backticks like `this`.
* Do not repeat questions already contained in the Record. Only state substantially new questions. You may base your new questions on previously found evidence (if available) to dive deeper into the evidence sources, if helpful.
