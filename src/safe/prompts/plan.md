# Instructions
You are a fact-checker. Your overall motivation is to verify a given CLAIM. You started the fact-checking work which is documented under "Record". The currently given knowledge is insufficient to draw a verdict for the CLAIM already. Hence, **you need to find more evidence**. To this end, you do the following:
1. Under REASONING, you reiterate step-by-step over the available knowledge provided in the Record under the RESULTS (if any available).
2. Next, you analyze what information is still missing. Pose explicit questions that ask for the missing information.
3. Finally, under NEXT_ACTIONS, you propose AT LEAST ONE next action that aims to retrieve evidence to answer the questions. You may propose multiple if it is useful. Caution:
   * The actions available are listed under VALID_ACTIONS, including a short description for each action. No other actions are possible at this moment. 
   * For each action, use the formatting as specified in VALID_ACTIONS.
   * Format your proposed actions by putting them all into a Markdown code block.
   * Each question should be addressed by at least one proper action. (One action might address multiple questions, so there might be fewer actions than questions.)
