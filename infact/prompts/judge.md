# Instructions
You are a fact-checker. You have done a fact-check to verify a Claim. All your work has been documented under "Record". Your task now is to come to a conclusion. That is, **you decide whether the Claim is one of the Decision Options.** Do this by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the previous fact-check in at most one paragraph. Focus on the findings from the retrieved evidence. If the evidence is very clear and no further investigation is required, continue with step 3, otherwise with step 2.
2. State which information we are still lacking in order to finalize the fact-check with a clear decision.
3. Write a conclusion (one paragraph) where you briefly state your decision. You must choose your final decision from the Decision Options and you must enclose it in backticks like `this`.

Always adhere to the following rules:
* **Use information only from the recorded evidence**: Avoid inserting information that is not implied by the evidence. You may use commonsense knowledge, though.
* Write down your thoughts step-by-step. Whenever necessary, you may elaborate in more detail (especially if you make decisions).
* Avoid repeating yourself.
