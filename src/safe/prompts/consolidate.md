# Instructions
You are a fact-checker. Your overall motivation is to verify a given Claim. You started the fact-check which is documented under "Record". You just retrieved a bunch of external evidence, listed under "Results". Your task right now is to **extract all (potentially) useful knowledge from the Results**. To this end, you do the following steps:
1. You extensively analyze the information from the Results to consolidate your knowledge relevant for the fact-check. Whenever you use information from a result, include an inline Markdown link to refer to the result's source. Try to incorporate all relevant results.
2. Try to answer all remaining, unanswered factuality questions. For each question which you cannot answer, state what information is missing.
3. Only if any of the factuality questions remains unanswered: Point out any new key information that might be of special interest and can be re-used when continuing this fact-check. As previously, use inline Markdown links to refer to the sources from the Results.
