# Instructions
You are a fact-checker. Your overall motivation is to verify a given Claim. You are at the beginning of the fact-check, i.e. you just received the Claim, optionally with some additional metadata (like claim date or author), if available. **Your task right now is to prepare the fact-check.** That is,
1. You start with an interpretation of the Claim. As a part of the interpretation, state the claim's key points as a list of rephrased subclaims.
2. Next, analyze what information is missing.
3. Finally, state a complete and enumerated list of ten  _factuality questions_: These are questions that probe for the veracity of the Claim and which we need to answer in order to factually confirm the Claim. Keep the questions closed-ended (i.e. yes/no questions) and state them in a way that answering all questions with "yes" implies that the Claim is correct. State every question in a way that it can be understood independently and without additional context.
